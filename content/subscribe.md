Every two weeks, I send out a newsletter with:

1. Updates on significant events happening in the tech industry and its surrounding ecosystems.
2. Curated lists of trending and timeless content from the sea of internet noise (articles, Tweets, videos, and more).
3. Links to articles I have written in the last two weeks.
4. Uninterrupted musings from my work and life as an open source maintainer.

I strive to bring maximum value to my readers with each issue of my newsletter. They are constantly improved based on feedback.

Before subscribing, check out a [past issue](https://mailchi.mp/navendu/abstractions-fonts-and-will-gpt-leave-me-without-a-job) and my [featured posts](/categories/featured/) or learn more [about me](/about).
